/*
The sequence of commands you provided demonstrates a series of interactions with a MySQL database. Here's a breakdown of each step:

1. `mysql -u root -p`: This command initiates a MySQL session, logging in as the user "root" and requesting a password.
2. `create database employee;`: This creates a new database named "employee".
3. `show databases;`: This command lists all the available databases, which should now include "employee".
4. `use employee;`: This statement selects the "employee" database, making it the active database for subsequent operations.
5. `create table employee1(...);`: This creates a table named "employee1" with three columns: "empid" (integer, primary key), "empname" (varchar of maximum length 40), and "empsal" (integer).
6. `create table salary as select empid,empsal from employee1;`: This creates a new table named "salary" by selecting the "empid" and "empsal" columns from the "employee1" table.
7. `alter table employee1 add empaddress varchar(100);`: This alters the "employee1" table to add a new column named "empaddress" with a maximum length of 100 characters.
8. `desc employee1;`: This command describes the structure of the "employee1" table, providing information about its columns.
9. `alter table employee1 drop column empaddress;`: This modifies the "employee1" table to remove the "empaddress" column.
10. `desc salary;`: This command describes the structure of the "salary" table, providing information about its columns.
11. `insert into employee1 values(...), (...);`: This inserts two rows of data into the "employee1" table with values for "empid", "empname", "empsal", and "empaddress" columns.
12. `select * from employee1;`: This retrieves all the rows and columns from the "employee1" table, displaying the data that was inserted.

These commands collectively demonstrate how to create databases, tables, alter table structures, describe table structures, insert data, and perform basic queries in MySQL
